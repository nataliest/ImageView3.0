# ImageView3.0
Plug-in for DAWs written in C++ using JUCE ImageView is an audio plugin that allows the user to view images in a directory of her choosing and copy images to the directory.

1. Choose a folder to link to the plug-in by clicking "Select Folder" or by dragging and dropping an existing folder.
2. Drag and drop your pictures of analog gear settings* (i.e. knob positions, diagrams etc.) to the folder you created. This will copy the files to the folder.
3. Quickly access and view your pictures from the plug-in; you can also write comments in the text editor below the image viewer. 
The plug-in displays JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF images.

*- the plug-in will work with other types of pictures as well; you can attach pictures of cats, puppies, or your favorite Home Depot aisles
